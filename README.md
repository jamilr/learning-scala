Learning functional programming language, Scala

The repository is a collection of solutions for algorithmic problems implemented in Scala programming language. 

I have got a strong interest and passion in mastering Scala as it creates an opportunity for building next generation highly scalable distributed systems for large-scala data processing. I am starting with learning the fundamentals of Scala - syntax, collections, concurrency.

Here are the list of solved problems

- Fibonacci
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Histogram
- Any Two Values Sum Up To K
